This repository contains the project **"U.S. Drought Intensity Trends Analysis"**, which examines biennial trends in U.S. drought intensity from 2000 to 2023 using data visualization techniques. The analysis aims to identify patterns in drought occurrences and intensities across different regions of the United States.

## üåü Project Overview

### ‚ú® Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends in U.S. drought intensity over the period from 2000 to 2023. By using data visualization techniques, we aim to:
- Identify temporal patterns in drought intensity.
- Highlight regions with significant changes in drought conditions.
- Provide insights into the trends and potential causes of these changes.

### üìä Data Source
The data for this analysis is sourced from the [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) and includes weekly drought classifications from 2000 to 2023, categorized into five levels:
1. **Abnormally Dry (D0)**
2. **Moderate Drought (D1)**
3. **Severe Drought (D2)**
4. **Extreme Drought (D3)**
5. **Exceptional Drought (D4)**

## üöÄ Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation
- Gathered weekly drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Aggregated data to a biennial level to observe long-term trends.
   
### Data Visualization
- Developed visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Created time series plots, heatmaps, and geographical maps to represent drought intensity trends.
- Analyzed the visualizations to extract meaningful insights regarding drought patterns and changes.

## üîç Key Findings
- Regions with increasing or decreasing drought intensity over time were identified.
- Significant temporal patterns in drought occurrences, including multi-year droughts and periods of recovery, were detected.
- A visual understanding of how drought intensity varies across different U.S. regions was provided.
